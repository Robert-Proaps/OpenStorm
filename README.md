# Welcome to OpenStorm
## The Open-Source and Accessible Lego-Like Robotics and Programming Standard

### What is Open Storm?
Open Storm at its core is a wiring and communications firmware standard that incorporates easy to access hardware along with commonly used communications protocols to enable the construction of robots using lego-like bricks with modular and easy to manage electronics hardware.

### How does it work?
The core of OpenStorm is a custom implementation of the Category-5 Ethernet cable and RJ45 jack which is used to connect modular custom built hardware that is compatible with common building blocks.
The limitations and design considerations are made around the Arduino Nano, as it is one of the most accessible MCU's on the market.
The wiring and startup standard is designed to make construction and wiring easy to start, while also allowing room for fully custom hardware and firmware design.
